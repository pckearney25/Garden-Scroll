# Garden-Scroll

A garden-themed site to explore the scrolling effects increasingly seen in web applications.

##Overview:
The application was created as an exercise to improve my front-end skills by understanding how create various scrolling and animation effects. I started with simple parallax effects and this lead my to the study of transitions, animations, transformations. I was inspired to start this project from the effects I was seeing more and more of at the New York Times site (www.newyorktimes.com) In coding this, my ultimate goal was a simple system to keep track of what triggered and effect, which element was effected by the trigger, and functions that could be used over and over again.

This was the first coding exercise I've done in which I've used complex objects. Director objects contain the information to trigger an effect. Actor objects contain the information that will be used to manipulate the styling. A "script" (JavaScript) conists of a list of reusable functions which each require both a director and actor object. The result is a fairly clean site that utilized pure functions.

I themed the site using photos from my visit to the Missouri Botanical Gardens last summer. This ultimately made the site fun to code, but finalizing the content and how to end the project to create a consistent narrative took far longer than I wanted. Content is hard!
