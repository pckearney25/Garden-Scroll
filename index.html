      The garden has inspired visitors for over 160 years. I wanted to convey a
      sense of that inspiration here through the magic of CSS and JavaScript.
      The slideshow above is achieved by the combination of the CSS animation
      and transform properties.

        Design Tip: An indidual element can have a huge visual impact, like this
        water lilly.

    <div class="comment-box">
      During my visit, every time I turned my head, I caught the site of
      something unexpected. You can do the same with a scrolling parallax
      effect, which is achieved by fixing an element’s background image relative
      to the viewport.
    </div>

    <div class="sliding-background-container">
      <div class="sliding-background"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="comment-box">
      You don't have to be Ken Burns to get this effect (above) of Henry Shaw's
      Grove House and formal garden. CSS animation is used to change the image's
      background position while the image's overflow is hidden by its parent
      container.
    </div>

    <div class="parallax" id="parallax-2">
      <!--Experimenting with text within the div-->
      <!--Here positioning it, when the texts extends beyond the vh, the image doesn't "move"-->
      <!--Next week I want the text to scroll with the window. (scroll within a scroll)-->
      <div class="parallax-comment-box">
        Design Tip: Grouping of elements can create a more dramatic effect, like
        a slideshow of images or a collection of pollinator-friendly plants.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="comment-box">
      A garden is created using many tools and techiques. Part of the fun of
      coding this site was using so many of the styling tools I studied
      individually in new combinaitions with each other.
    </div>
    <div class="parallax" id="parallax-3">
      <div class="parallax-comment-box">
        Design Tip: The repeition of a limited number of colors and effects will
        be far more impactful than incorporating everything under the sun.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="comment-box">
      Immediately above and below this box, the code for the classic parallax
      effect is repeated with only text changes to the "Design Tip" boxes in
      order to create what appears to be a much bigger parallax effect.
    </div>

    <div class="parallax" id="parallax-4">
      <div class="parallax-comment-box">
        Design Tip: Effects should support the message, not overwhelm it.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="comment-box">
      Garden and web design constantly change. The introduction of new
      varietals, like the red coneflowers in the image above and the video
      background in the parallax below, can make the familiar seem new again.
    </div>

    <div class="video-parallax">
      <video id="bee-video" autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="./assets/movies/bee-bee-movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
      <div class="parallax-comment-box">
        Design Tip: Garden and code with the users' eperience in mind. Designs
        should attract users like bees to this bee bee tree.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="comment-box" id="second-js-box">
      Triggered Effects: Many sites today incorporate styling effects that are
      triggered when the user scrolls to a specific location on the page. Two
      common types are abrupt and progressive effects.
    </div>

    <div class="effect-container" id="abrupt-demo-container">
      <div class="effect-header">Abrupt Scrolling Effects</div>
      <div id="animation-div">
        <div class="animation-box">
          <div class="circle" id="circle-1"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="animation-box">
          <div class="circle" id="circle-2"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="animation-box">
          <div class="circle" id="circle-3"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="animation-box">
          <div class="circle" id="circle-4"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="comment-box" id="third-js-box">
      Abrupt Effects: When an element reaches a certain position on the page, an
      animation, transition, or transformation or simple style change is
      triggered in a second element. Javascript is used to change to the class
      or id attributes of these secondary elements. Above, the parent container
      "directs" the circles to pop by triggering.
    </div>
    <div class="effect-container" id="progressive-demo-container">
      <div class="effect-header">Progressive Scrolling Effects</div>
      <div id="moving-frames-div">
        <span id="span-box-1"></span> <span id="span-box-2"></span>
        <span id="span-box-3"></span> <span id="span-box-4"></span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="comment-box" id="fourth-js-box">
      Progressive Effects: As an element moves between two predefined positions
      on the page, JavaScript is used to enact a gradual change in the CSS
      styling of a second element. The color changes and movements of the
      squares (above) are progressive effects. This comment box also utilizes
      progressive effects to change text and background colors.
    </div>
    <div class="parallax-move-background" id="parallax-5">
      <div class="parallax-comment-box" id="cypress-comment-box">
        Design Tip: With triggered effects, you can present information in a
        more controlled way while providing an enjoyable user experience .
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="comment-box" id="fifth-js-box">
      Of course, in coding and gardening, effects can be combined to create real
      vibrancy! Below we have a parallax animated slide show with an abrupt
      message box appearance and disappearence.
    </div>
    <div class="parallax-slideshow-container" id="conclusion-container">
