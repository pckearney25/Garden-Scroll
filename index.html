      The garden has inspired visitors for over 160 years. I wanted to convey a
      sense of that inspiration here through the magic of CSS and JavaScript.
      The slideshow above is achieved by the combination of the CSS animation
      and transform properties.

      During my visit, every time I turned my head, I caught the site of
      something unexpected. You can do the same with a scrolling parallax
      effect, which is achieved by fixing an elementâ€™s background image relative
      to the viewport.

      You don't have to be Ken Burns to get this effect of Henry Shaw's Grove
      House and formal garden. CSS animation is used to change the image's
      background position while the image's overflow is hidden by its parent
      container.

      <!--Experimenting with text within the div-->

        Design Tip: Grouping of elements can create a more dramatic effect, like
        a slideshow of images or a collection of pollinator-friendly plants.

      A garden is created using many tools and techiques. Part of the fun of
      coding this site was using so many of the styling tools I studied
      individually in new combinaitions with each other.

        Design Tip: The repeition of a limited number of colors and effects will
        be far more impactful than incorporating everything under the sun.

      Immediately above and below this box, the code for the classic parallax
      effect is repeated with only text changes to the "Design Tip" boxes in
      order to create what appears to be a much bigger parallax effect.

      Garden and web design constantly change. The introduction of new
      varietals, like the red coneflowers in the image above and the video
      background in the parallax below, can make the familiar seem new again.

      Today more and more sites incorporate styling effects that are produced
      when the user scrolls to a specific location on the page. There are two
      types: abrupt and progressive effects.

    <div class="comment-box" id="third-js-box">
      Abrupt Effects: When an element reaches a certain position on the page, an
      animation, transition, or transformation or simple style change is
      triggerd in a second element. A simple way to do this is to use JavaScript
      to change the class or id attribute of the second element.

    <div class="comment-box" id="fourth-js-box">
      Progressive Effects: As an element moves between two predefined positions
      on the page, JavaScript is used to enact a gradual change in the CSS
      styling of a second element.

      Managing Multiple Scrolling Effects: OK, we're going to have to leave the
