      The garden has inspired visitors for over 160 years. I wanted to convey a
      sense of that inspiration here through the magic of CSS and JavaScript.
      The slideshow above is achieved by the combination of the CSS animation
      and transform properties.

      During my visit, every time I turned my head, I caught the site of
      something unexpected. You can do the same with a scrolling parallax
      effect, which is achieved by fixing an elementâ€™s background image relative
      to the viewport.

      You don't have to be Ken Burns to get this effect of Henry Shaw's Grove
      House and formal garden. CSS animation is used to change the image's
      background position while the image's overflow is hidden by its parent
      container.

      <!--Experimenting with text within the div-->
      <!--Here positioning it, when the texts extends beyond the vh, the image doesn't "move"-->

        Design Tip: The grouping of elements can create a more dramatic effect,
        like a slideshow of images or these groupings of pollinator-friendly Joe
        Pye weed, rudbeckia, and lillies.

      A garden is created using many tools and techiques. Part of the fun of
      coding this site was using so many of the styling tools I studied
      individually in new combinaitions with each other.

      Immediately above and below this box, the code for the classic parallax
      effect is repeated with only a text change to the lower "Design Tip Box"
      in order to create what appears to be a much bigger parallax effect.

      Garden and web design constantly change. The introduction of new varietals
      like the red coneflowers in the image above and the video background in
      the parallax image below, can make the familiar seem new again.
